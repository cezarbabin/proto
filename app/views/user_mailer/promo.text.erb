  Dear student,

  We think that the hiring process is broken. You have to fill out dozens of applications, attend career fairs,
  and answer the same interview questions over and over again. None of this reflects who you really are or how you think.
  It is a process designed by employers with the main goal of filtering candidates.

  At pentalist, we want to change that. We are working at the intersection of artificial intelligence, cognitive science and management
  to match students with employment opportunities. Instead of relying on metrics such as GPA or your resume, we are designing
  a hollisic assesment process that can reflect candidates more objectively.

  If you share our vision, visit us at https://www.pentalist.org to find out more information.

  Thank you,
  The pentalist team
